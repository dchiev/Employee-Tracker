## Process
_____________________________________
1. I began by adding all my requirements like express, mysql, etc.

2. I then created my employees_db and added the necessary schema and seed data into mySQL.

3. I the made my connections to the local host via express.

4. Via inquirer, I created a prompt with certain actions (i.e. See Employees, add role, etc.).

5. I then used the switch for each answer and attached the appropiate functions.

6. Under each functions, i made mySQL queries to either update a role, view employees, etc.


## Challenges
_____________________________________

The main challenge I found in this assignment was the update functionality. The difficulty here was taking the appropiate response, then pushing that into a mySQL query.
